## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite apps

- Instagram
-   Deleting old messages
-   stories

- Tik Tok
-   The fyp
-   Easy to share content

- Snapchat
-   deleting old messages
-   privacy on who views your app

-   An app that I would like to build is an app where you can review music
    and share those reviews with others. Everyone should be allowed to rate
    favorite albums or songs or not so favorite and the users of the app are
    allowed to like and upvote these reviews. And there should be a feature that
    helps the user find the music the app thinks they would listen to.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
